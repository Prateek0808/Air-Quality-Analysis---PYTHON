## Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze air quality data of Indian states using Python programming language. The project aims to provide insights into the air quality of different Indian states and identify which states have the highest levels of pollution. The project will analyze data for different pollutants such as particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. The project will use Pandas library for data processing and Matplotlib library for data visualization. The project will provide recommendations for improving the air quality and encourage policymakers to take action to address the issue.

## Introduction:

This project analyzes air quality data of Indian states using Python programming language. The data is obtained from the [Open Goverment Data (OGD)](https://data.gov.in/) website. The project aims to provide insights into the air quality of different Indian states and identify which states have the highest levels of pollution.

## Methodology:

In this project, I used Python to examine the “Air Quality” dataset. I imported the data by first downloading the data and saving it as a .csv file, then I used the read.csv function in Python to begin the analysis.

## Conclusion:

The air quality of Indian states is a major concern, and this project aims to provide insights into the air quality of different states using Python programming language. The project shows that the air quality of different states varies widely, and some states have higher levels of pollution than others. The project provides recommendations for improving the air quality and encourages policymakers to take action to address the issue.
